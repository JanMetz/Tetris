# Tetris

This is a simple recreation of the famous game Tetris in Rust language.

It is a cross-platform console application which uses crossterm library (https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.27.0/crossterm/) for visualization.

You can interact with the game using your keyboard:
 - press the arrow key 'Up' to rotate the brick
 - press the arrow key 'Left' to move the brick to the left
 - press the arrow key 'Right' to move the brick to the right
 - press ctrl + c to terminate the game

You can compile and run the project using Cargo. https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/
